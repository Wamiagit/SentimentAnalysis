# SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment Analysis on the Sentiment140 dataset of Tweets using BLSTMs, Attention mechanisms, and CNNs in Keras. Includes experimental Notebooks on positional encoding which do not require the use of any recurrent layers.

## Training Data

## Problems opening on github?
If github fails to render any of the notebooks, you can visit the [jupyter website](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste the link to any of these notebooks to have it rendered there.
